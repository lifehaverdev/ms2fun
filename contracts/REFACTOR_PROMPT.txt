The MasterRegistryV1 contract is too large to deploy on mainnet:
- Current: 60,096 bytes
- Limit: 24,576 bytes
- Overage: 144% over limit

Please refactor src/master/MasterRegistryV1.sol to reduce its size below the 24KB limit while preserving all functionality.

Key requirements:
1. Keep all existing functionality (factory registry, vault management, governance deployment)
2. Maintain interface compatibility for frontend integration
3. Preserve proxy pattern upgradability
4. Ensure all tests still pass

Suggested approach:
- Extract governance deployment logic into a separate helper contract
- Consider splitting into modules (Core, Factory, Vault logic)
- Use libraries for complex operations
- Replace long error strings with custom errors

Full specification: See CONTRACT_SIZE_REFACTOR_TASK.md

Please analyze the contract and propose a refactoring plan, then implement it.
