AGENT PROMPT: Add CULT EXEC Project Card to Home Page
================================================================================

CONTEXT:

You are adding a hardcoded CULT EXEC project card to the top of the home page 
project discovery. This card should be prominently displayed and navigate to 
the `/cultexecs` route when clicked.

CURRENT STATE:

✅ ProjectDiscovery component displays project cards from mock data
✅ ProjectCard component handles navigation
✅ CULT EXEC already appears in project discovery (from mock data)
⚠️ Need a hardcoded, featured CULT EXEC card at the top of the list

YOUR MISSION:

Add a hardcoded CULT EXEC project card that:
1. Appears at the top of the project list on the home page
2. Is visually distinct/featured
3. Navigates to `/cultexecs` when clicked
4. Uses the existing ProjectCard component for consistency
5. Is separate from the mock data projects

================================================================================
TASKS
================================================================================

TASK 1: UNDERSTAND CURRENT STRUCTURE
-------------------------------------

Files to examine:
- src/components/ProjectDiscovery/ProjectDiscovery.js
- src/components/ProjectDiscovery/ProjectCard.js
- src/routes/HomePage.js

Current behavior:
- ProjectDiscovery fetches projects from ProjectRegistry
- Projects are displayed in a grid
- CULT EXEC may already appear in the list (from mock data)
- ProjectCard handles click navigation

TASK 2: ADD HARDCODED CULT EXEC CARD
-------------------------------------

Modify ProjectDiscovery component to:
1. Create a hardcoded CULT EXEC project object
2. Render it as the first card in the project grid
3. Ensure it's visually distinct (featured styling)
4. Make it navigate to `/cultexecs` when clicked

Implementation approach:

Option A: Add to ProjectDiscovery component
- Create hardcoded CULT EXEC project object
- Prepend to projects array before rendering
- Use existing ProjectCard component
- Ensure navigation goes to `/cultexecs`

Option B: Add in HomePage before ProjectDiscovery
- Create separate featured section
- Render CULT EXEC card separately
- Then render ProjectDiscovery below

RECOMMENDATION: Option A (integrate into ProjectDiscovery)

TASK 3: ENSURE VISUAL DISTINCTION
----------------------------------

The CULT EXEC card should be visually distinct:
- Use existing "featured" styling if available
- Or add new "cult-exec-featured" class
- Should stand out but not clash with design system

Check ProjectCard.js for:
- Featured badge/styling
- How featured projects are displayed
- Any existing CULT EXEC special handling

TASK 4: HANDLE NAVIGATION
---------------------------

Ensure clicking the card navigates to `/cultexecs`:
- ProjectCard already has logic for CULT EXEC navigation
- Check: `if (this.project.name === 'CULT EXEC') { this.onNavigate('/cultexecs'); }`
- Ensure hardcoded project object has `name: 'CULT EXEC'`

TASK 5: PREVENT DUPLICATION
----------------------------

If CULT EXEC already appears in mock data:
- Filter it out from the regular project list
- Or ensure the hardcoded one appears first and is distinct
- Avoid showing CULT EXEC twice

================================================================================
IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
================================================================================

CULT EXEC PROJECT OBJECT:

Create a hardcoded project object with:
```javascript
const cultExecProject = {
    name: 'CULT EXEC',
    address: '0x185485bF2e26e0Da48149aee0A8032c8c2060Db2', // Real CULT EXEC address
    contractType: 'ERC404',
    description: 'The flagship ERC404 project. Bonding curve trading with automatic NFT minting.',
    stats: {
        volume: 'High',
        holders: 'Growing',
        totalSupply: 'Dynamic'
    },
    // Add any other fields ProjectCard expects
    isFeatured: true,
    isHardcoded: true // Flag to distinguish from mock data
};
```

INTEGRATION POINT:

In ProjectDiscovery component, modify the render or update method:
1. Get projects from registry (existing code)
2. Filter out CULT EXEC if it exists in mock data
3. Prepend hardcoded CULT EXEC project to the array
4. Render all projects (CULT EXEC will be first)

Example:
```javascript
// In ProjectDiscovery.js
async loadProjects() {
    const projects = await this.projectRegistry.getAllProjects();
    
    // Filter out CULT EXEC from mock data if present
    const filteredProjects = projects.filter(p => p.name !== 'CULT EXEC');
    
    // Create hardcoded CULT EXEC project
    const cultExecProject = {
        name: 'CULT EXEC',
        address: '0x185485bF2e26e0Da48149aee0A8032c8c2060Db2',
        contractType: 'ERC404',
        description: 'The flagship ERC404 project. Bonding curve trading with automatic NFT minting.',
        stats: {
            volume: 'High',
            holders: 'Growing'
        },
        isFeatured: true
    };
    
    // Prepend CULT EXEC to projects
    this.setState({
        projects: [cultExecProject, ...filteredProjects]
    });
}
```

STYLING:

If ProjectCard already supports featured styling:
- The `isFeatured` flag should trigger it
- Check ProjectCard.js for featured badge/styling

If not, ensure the card looks distinct:
- Could add a special border or background
- Could use a different card style
- Should match the design system

NAVIGATION:

ProjectCard already handles CULT EXEC navigation:
```javascript
// In ProjectCard.js (existing code)
if (this.project.name === 'CULT EXEC') {
    this.onNavigate('/cultexecs');
    return;
}
```

Ensure the hardcoded project object has `name: 'CULT EXEC'` exactly.

================================================================================
TESTING REQUIREMENTS
================================================================================

After implementation, verify:

1. Display:
   - [ ] CULT EXEC card appears at the top of the project list
   - [ ] Card is visually distinct/featured
   - [ ] Card shows correct information (name, description, etc.)
   - [ ] Card styling matches design system

2. Navigation:
   - [ ] Clicking card navigates to `/cultexecs`
   - [ ] Navigation works from home page
   - [ ] No console errors

3. Duplication:
   - [ ] CULT EXEC doesn't appear twice in the list
   - [ ] Only the hardcoded card appears (not from mock data)

4. Responsive:
   - [ ] Card displays correctly on mobile
   - [ ] Card displays correctly on desktop
   - [ ] Grid layout works with featured card

================================================================================
SUCCESS CRITERIA
================================================================================

✅ CULT EXEC card appears at top of home page project list
✅ Card is visually distinct/featured
✅ Clicking card navigates to `/cultexecs`
✅ No duplication (only one CULT EXEC card)
✅ Styling is consistent with design system
✅ Works on mobile and desktop

================================================================================
REFERENCE FILES
================================================================================

- src/components/ProjectDiscovery/ProjectDiscovery.js (main component)
- src/components/ProjectDiscovery/ProjectCard.js (card component)
- src/routes/HomePage.js (home page route)
- src/components/ProjectDiscovery/ProjectCard.js (check for featured styling)

================================================================================
IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
================================================================================

1. **Keep it Simple:**
   - Use existing ProjectCard component
   - Don't create a new component unless necessary
   - Reuse existing navigation logic

2. **Design Consistency:**
   - Match existing project card styling
   - Use featured badge if available
   - Don't break the grid layout

3. **Code Organization:**
   - Add hardcoded project in ProjectDiscovery component
   - Keep it separate from mock data logic
   - Add comments explaining why it's hardcoded

4. **Future Considerations:**
   - This is a temporary solution until CULT EXEC is properly integrated
   - Consider making it configurable later
   - Document why it's hardcoded

================================================================================
START IMPLEMENTATION
================================================================================

1. Examine ProjectDiscovery.js to understand current structure
2. Check ProjectCard.js for featured styling and navigation
3. Add hardcoded CULT EXEC project object
4. Integrate into ProjectDiscovery render logic
5. Test navigation and display
6. Verify no duplication

The goal is a clean, featured CULT EXEC card at the top of the home page that 
navigates to the CULT EXEC trading interface.

Good luck!
